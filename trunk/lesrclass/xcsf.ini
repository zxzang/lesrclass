##### experiments & output ####################################################
# numberOfExperiments   Specifies the number of investigated experiments.
# averageExploitTrials  The number of test instances that should be averaged
#                       in the performance evaluation.
# initialSeed           The initialization of the pseudo random generator.
#                       Must be at least one and smaller than 2147483647. Will
#                       be used only if "doRandomize" is set to false.
# doRandomize           Specifies if the seed should be randomized (based on
#                       the current milliseconds of the computer time). For
#                       reproducable experiments turn off multi-threading.
# multiThreading        Indicates the use of multi-threaded matching to speed
#                       up the learning time. Note that multi-threaded
#                       experiments are not reproducable due to concurrency.
# threadingThreshold    If the actual population size is below this threshold,
#                       serial single-core matching is applied. If the size is
#                       above the threshold, multi-threading is activated. The
#                       value can also be set to 'auto', which indicates that
#                       XCSF automatically adapts the threshold depending on
#                       periodical system time measurements. The latter assures
#                       that XCSF does not waste time with multi-threading
#                       where not appropriate, but starts multi-threading when
#                       there is a speedup. This depends on the architecture,
#                       the condition type and the underlying problem.
#                       Default: auto
# verbose               If this flag is true, XCSF prints informative messages
#                       about its current status, otherwise nothing is printed
#                       at all.
