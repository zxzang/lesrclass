This Learning Classifier System is a an independent study project at Cal State-Los Angeles.  The system attempts to learn predictive rules based on historical securities price fluctuations.  I originally used homegrown LCS functionality with ECJ for the genetic algorithm piece, but at present I am switching to the open-source JAVAXCSF.
