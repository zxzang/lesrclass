johnwhurley@gmail.com   LCS using security price information     This Learning Classifier System is a an independent study project at Cal State-Los Angeles.

I originally used homegrown LCS functionality with ECJ for the genetic algorithm piece, but at present I am switching to the open-source JAVAXCSF.
